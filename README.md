# mnist-handwritten-numbers-detection
Detection of handwritten digits using Neural Networks with 98% accuracy.
Training a neural network with MNIST handwritten digits.
The MNIST dataset contains 28 x 28 pixel values of handwritten digits.
The Neural Network contains input layer of 784 nodes, 1 hidden layer of 200 nodes and output layer of 10 nodes.
the Neural network is trained for 5 epochs with learning rate of 0.1 to give approximately 98% accuracy on the test data.
